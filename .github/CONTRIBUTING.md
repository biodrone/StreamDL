# Git Commit Message Best Practice
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

# Submitting Pull Requests
Please always submit PRs to the staging branch, never to master.
Features will be moved to master once they have been adequately tested in staging.
